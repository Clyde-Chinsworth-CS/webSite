<h3>BIO</h3>
<p>Hirohiko Araki grew up in Sendai, Japan with his parents and younger identical twin sisters. Araki states that his sisters' annoyances as the reason he spent time alone in his room reading manga. He states that his fathers' art books and the manga Ai to Makoto to be his motive for drawing manga. After a school friend praised his manga, Araki began secretly drawing manga. He submitted his work during his first year of high school, but all submissions were declined. After visiting the publishes' offices in person, the Shueisha editor he met highly criticized his work, but said it had potential.
<h3>DEBUT</h3>
  <p>After leaving the Miyagi University of Education before graduating, Araki made his debut with his one-shot, <i>Poker Under Arms</i>, which was a "Selected Work" at that year's Tezuka Award. His first official manga was <i>Shock B.T.</i>
